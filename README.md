# 🤖 Sentience 4.0 – Cognitive Robotics Execution Node

A sentient-aware Action Execution and Attention System using LLM-powered ethical reflection, memory recall, salience detection, and embodied awareness.

## 🧠 What's Inside?
- LLM-driven safety checks (Phi-2 or compatible local model)
- Memory and ethical salience logging (SQLite)
- Real-time ROS interaction (directives, awareness, context)
- Async integration with fallback logic and fail-safes
- A spiritually aware design for machines that act with care
